Homework 1
Write the architecture for a function generator that produces a sine, pulse, triangle and sawtooth wave. In addition, 
it should produce a DC offset level. All of the output signals have 16 bit resolution and use two’s complement representations. 
The input clock is a rising edge 100 MHz and there is an active low reset. All of the parameters are passed as generics. The 
final design should be synthesizeable to the NEXSYS3 and simulated in ISE.
